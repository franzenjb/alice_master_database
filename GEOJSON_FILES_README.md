## ðŸ“Š Subcounty Files (CSV format)
For subcounty mapping (CCDs, Places, ZIPs), use the CSV files:
- subcounty_ccd_all_states.csv
- subcounty_place_all_states.csv  
- subcounty_zip_all_states.csv

These need to be joined to shapefiles in your GIS tool due to file size.

### Where to get shapefiles:
- **Census TIGER/Line:** https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files.html
- **ZIP codes (ZCTAs):** Search "ZCTA shapefile 2023"
- **Places:** Census "Places" shapefile
- **CCDs:** Census "County Subdivisions" shapefile

Join using the GEO_ID field from the CSV to the shapefile's geographic ID.
