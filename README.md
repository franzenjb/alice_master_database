## üìà KEY METRICS EXPLAINED

### ALICE Data Fields (In All Files)

| Field | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Total_Households** | All households in this area |
| **Poverty_Households** | Households below Federal Poverty Level (FPL) |
| **ALICE_Households** | Households above FPL but below survival budget (the "working poor") |
| **Above_ALICE_Households** | Households that can afford basic needs |

### Calculate These Key Metrics

**Poverty Rate (%):**
```
(Poverty_Households / Total_Households) √ó 100
```

**ALICE Rate (%):**
```
(ALICE_Households / Total_Households) √ó 100
```

**Combined Vulnerability Rate (%):** ‚Üê **USE THIS FOR CHOROPLETH MAPS**
```
((Poverty_Households + ALICE_Households) / Total_Households) √ó 100
```

## üó∫Ô∏è HOW TO MAP THIS DATA

### Step 1: Choose Your File
- County map ‚Üí MASTER file
- City map ‚Üí subcounty_place file
- ZIP map ‚Üí subcounty_zip file

### Step 2: Get Shapefiles
Download from US Census TIGER/Line:
- Counties: https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html
- Places: Same site, select "Places"
- ZCTAs: Same site, select "ZIP Code Tabulation Areas"

### Step 3: Join Data to Shapefile
**Join Field:**
- Counties ‚Üí Use **FIPS** field (5-digit code like "12001")
- Places ‚Üí Use **GEO_ID** field
- ZIPs ‚Üí Use **GEO_ID** field (5-digit ZIP)

### Step 4: Create Choropleth
**Color by:** Combined Vulnerability Rate (calculate as shown above)

**Recommended Color Scale:**
- 0-20%: Green (Low vulnerability)
- 20-40%: Yellow (Moderate)
- 40-60%: Orange (High)
- 60%+: Red (Very High vulnerability)

### Step 5: Filter by Red Cross Organization
- **By Chapter:** `Chapter == "ARC of North Central Florida"`
- **By Region:** `Region == "Florida Region"`
- **By Division:** `Division == "Southeast and Caribbean Division"`

**Goal:** Show which counties in your Chapter have highest need

**Steps:**
1. Open MASTER file
2. Filter: `Chapter == "Your Chapter Name"` AND `Year == 2023`
3. Calculate: `Vulnerability_Rate = (Poverty_Households + ALICE_Households) / Total_Households * 100`
4. Join to county shapefile using FIPS
5. Create choropleth colored by Vulnerability_Rate
6. Add labels with county names

**Goal:** Show how vulnerability has changed over time

**Steps:**
1. Open MASTER file
2. Select years: 2010, 2016, 2023
3. Calculate vulnerability rate for each year

5. Show increase/decrease by county

### 3. Grant Application Support
**Goal:** Demonstrate need for funding

**Steps:**
1. Open MASTER file, filter to 2023

3. Export list with:
   - County name
   - Vulnerability %
   - Total affected households
   - Population
   - Median income
4. Add narrative about "working poor" (ALICE households)

### 4. City-Level Analysis
